          Donate your chances of winning to support public goods, and keep your
          deposit. With every dollar you deposit, PoolTogether gives you a
          chance to win that resets every day. By delegating your deposit and
          locking it for a duration of days, 100% of the prizes you win go
          directly to retroactive public goods funding.

        <Accordion.Body>
          PoolTogether is a no loss prize protocol with a "delegation" feature.
          It allows a depositor to give their chances to win prizes to any other
          address. When delegating, you maintain full control of your funds and
          can withdraw or take back your chances to win at any time. This dapp
          delegates winnings to Optimism RetroPGF address through a series of
          multiple transactions. Candide Wallet executes all transactions in a
          signle one.
